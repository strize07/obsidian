as you are born, you suffer and there is nothing in the world that could possibly undo that.

And now i wish to have never been born as this world would have been better off since

but It's not worth the bother of killing yourself, since always kill yourself too late.

but you also are grateful to be born to see, to hear, to feel and wonder most who could have been born would never be born

all this mixed feeling eats you inside as you feel stuck and paralyzed nowhere to go or return 

why do i have to suffer, why am i
